#### Project Purpose:
This is a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating integration between GitLab and Snowflake
It implements an MLOps pipeline for deploying machine learning models to Snowflake

### Infrastructure & Environment:
Uses Python 3.11 as the base environment
Integrates with Snowflake for data storage and computation
Uses GitLab CI/CD for automation
Supports multiple environments (dev, qa, prod) with corresponding schemas

### Project Structure:
features/: Contains feature engineering code
length_of_stay.py: Implements length of stay calculations
models/: Contains different model implementations
cpc/: CPC (likely Cost Per Click) model
edc/: EDC model
fuec/: FUEC model
ensemble/: Ensemble model implementations
tasks/: Contains automation tasks
model_tasks.py: Handles model execution tasks

### CI/CD Pipeline:
The pipeline consists of four stages:
snowflake-setup: Establishes connection with Snowflake
feature-deploy: Deploys feature engineering code
model-deploy: Deploys various models (CPC, FUEC, EDC)
task-deploy: Deploys model execution tasks

### Environment Management:
Automatically sets appropriate schemas based on branch:
dev branch → DEV schema
qa branch → QA schema
main branch → PROD schema
Uses separate feature store schemas for each environment

### Security & Configuration:
Uses secure file handling for sensitive information
Implements private key-based authentication with Snowflake
Configuration is managed through environment variables
Includes proper GitLab pipeline protections and controls

### Pipeline Rules:
Allows manual runs of feature branches from UI
Never runs on merge request events
Automatically runs on protected branches (dev, qa, main)
Includes proper workflow controls and protections

### Best Practice Considerations
Environment separation
Secure credential management
Automated deployment
Feature engineering
Model deployment
Task automation

The project demonstrates a mature approach to MLOps, with proper separation of concerns between feature engineering, model development, and task automation, all integrated with Snowflake's data platform.
